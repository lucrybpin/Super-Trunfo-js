Card Game Like Top Trumps write in HTML5 + Javascript using the Canvas and OOP

##Start Date:

###Last Update:
3/3/2016

###Status:
In Progress

###Features:
- **Card**: can now create a card object with properties
- **cardList**: our card "database"
- **getRandomCard**: generates a random card from the cardList
- **Deck**: can now create your deck with name, size, push cards into your deck and draw cards from your deck

###Development:
Im a little confused on how to draw in canvas the card. I already can draw a generic card with no information and position setting its x and y position in canvas but Im not sure if I should implement a GameObject that handle the position stuff alone or if I should incorporate the position and draw stuff inside the Card class.

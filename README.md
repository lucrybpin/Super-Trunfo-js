# Super-Trunfo-js

###Description:
Card Game Like Top Trumps write in HTML5 + Javascript using the Canvas and OOP

###Last Update:
1/3/2016

###Status:
In Progress

###Features:
- Card: can now create a card object with properties
- cardList: our card "database"
- getRandomCard: generates a random card from the cardList
- Deck: can create now a deck with name, size and push cards into it

###Development:
Im a little confused on how to draw in canvas the card. I already can draw a generic card with no information and position setting its x and y position in canvas but Im not sure if I should implement a GameObject that handle the position stuff alone or if I should incorporate the position and draw stuff inside the Card class.
